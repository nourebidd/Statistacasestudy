 Statista Case Study – Data Extraction & Financial Dataset Preparation

This repository contains my solution for the Statista Working Student – Data Engineering** case study.  
The task was to extract company data from a publicly available source, clean it, merge multi-year financials, and produce a structured dataset including at least 100 companies.

 Dataset Source

I used the Forbes Global 2000** datasets for the years:

- **2020**
- **2021**
- **2022**

These datasets are publicly available from Kaggle and other Forbes archival sources.

Each dataset provides:

- Company Name  
- Country  
- Industry  
- Revenue (Sales)  
- Net Income  
- Assets  
- Market Value  

This makes it suitable for building a multi-year financial dataset.

Approach & Methodology

 Data Loading:

All three Excel datasets were loaded using:

python
pd.read_excel()
                         Standardizing Column Names
Before merging, the financial columns from each year were renamed:
Sales → rev_YYYY
Profits → net_income_YYYY
Assets → assets_YYYY
Market_Value → market_cap_YYYY
This  ensures consistent naming across all years.
                         Merging the Datasets
All datasets were merged using:
merge(..., on=["company", "country", "industry"], how="outer")
This keeps all companies that appear in any of the three years.
                         Preparing the Final Dataset
The final dataset includes:
Company
Country
Industry
Revenue for 2020–2022
Net Income for 2020–2022
Assets for 2020–2022
Market Cap for 2020–2022
Revenue Unit (USD)
I selected the top 300 companies alphabetically to stay within the required range (100–500).
The cleaned dataset is exported as:
